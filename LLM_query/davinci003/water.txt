
<edge>C_NI_12_00->C_NI_12_15</edge>: This edge indicates that the concentration of nitrogen inorganic ions at 00 minutes is directly responsible for the concentration of nitrogen inorganic ions at 15 minutes. This is because the concentration of nitrogen inorganic ions is measured at different time periods, and the change in concentration over time is directly related to the initial concentration.

<edge>CKNI_12_00->CKNI_12_15</edge>: This edge indicates that the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen inorganic ions at 00 minutes is directly responsible for the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen inorganic ions at 15 minutes. This is because the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen inorganic ions is measured at different time periods, and the change in concentration over time is directly related to the initial concentration.

<edge>CBODD_12_00->CBODD_12_15</edge>: This edge indicates that the concentration of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand for degradable organic matter at 00 minutes is directly responsible for the concentration of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand for degradable organic matter at 15 minutes. This is because the concentration of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand for degradable organic matter is measured at different time periods, and the change in concentration over time is directly related to the initial concentration.

<edge>CKND_12_00->CKND_12_15</edge>: This edge indicates that the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen degradable ions at 00 minutes is directly responsible for the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen degradable ions at 15 minutes. This is because the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen degradable ions is measured at different time periods, and the change in concentration over time is directly related to the initial concentration.

<edge>CNOD_12_00->CNOD_12_15</edge>: This edge indicates that the concentration of nitrogenous oxygen demand at 00 minutes is directly responsible for the concentration of nitrogenous oxygen demand at 15 minutes. This is because the concentration of nitrogenous oxygen demand is measured at different time periods, and the change in concentration over time is directly related to the initial concentration.

<edge>CBODN_12_00->CBODN_12_15</edge>: This edge indicates that the concentration of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand for nitrogenous matter at 00 minutes is directly responsible for the concentration of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand for nitrogenous matter at 15 minutes. This is because the concentration of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand for nitrogenous matter is measured at different time periods, and the change in concentration over time is directly related to the initial concentration.

<edge>CKNN_12_00->CKNN_12_15</edge>: This edge indicates that the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen non-degradable ions at 00 minutes is directly responsible for the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen non-degradable ions at 15 minutes. This is because the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen non-degradable ions is measured at different time periods, and the change in concentration over time is directly related to the initial concentration.

<edge>CNON_12_00->CNON_12_15</edge>: This edge indicates that the concentration of nitrogenous non-degradable organic nitrogen at 00 minutes is directly responsible for the concentration of nitrogenous non-degradable organic nitrogen at 15 minutes. This is because the concentration of nitrogenous non-degradable organic nitrogen is measured at different time periods, and the change in concentration over time is directly related to the initial concentration.
