Here is a list of potential causal relationships based on the given information:

<edge>CKNBIO_12_00->NO_3</edge> (Sodium Nitrate Concentration): CKNBIO represents the concentration of oxidizable biodegradable compounds with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide used as the oxidizing agent in the analysis. This can be converted into the total dissolved ammonia (TDA) value, which includes both unionized and ionized forms of ammonia, including nitrite, nitrate, and others. As TDA increases, so does the amount of ammonia present, which will result in an increase of ammonium (NH_4 ) ions in solution, eventually leading to higher NO_3 concentrations. Therefore, there is a direct causal relationship between CKNBIO_12_00 and NO_3 .
<edge>CZOD_12_00->CHEM_OXYGEN_DEMAND (Chemical Oxygen Demand): CZOD_12_00 represents the concentration of chemical oxygen demand using silver sulfate. Since CHEM_OXYGEN_DEMAND measures the amount of oxygen required by oxidizable substances in water sample under certain conditions, the causal direction should point from CZOD to CHEM_OXYGEN_DEMAND instead of vice versa. However, this arrow cannot exist since we don't see any change points (or edges) pointing toward other nodes except those directly connected to inputs. It seems the true causal directions are only reflected through these inputs. So I assume that the two arrows connecting them in their causal graphs might be reversed. Therefore, we have CHEM_OXYGEN_DEMAND->CZOD_12_00 here.
<edge>CORDOD_12_00, CKNI_12_00, etc.->CNOD_12_00</edge> (Carbon Dioxide Equivalents): CKNI_12_00, CKOBIO_12_00, CODB_12_00, CORS_12_00, CORD_12_00, CBDOC_12_00, CZOD_12_00: These variables measure various parameters related to chemical reactions of different groups in water samples. They may influence the concentration of Carbon Dioxide equivalents (CODC) via complex interactions such as substrates supply, oxygen consumption, acidification effects, and pH changes. Since they share the same edge pointing towards CNOD_12_00 node, we put these five pairs together.
<edge>NITRITE_12_00->CKINI_12_00, NITRATE_12_00->CKIPI_12_00</edge>: Although it's not clear how NITRITE_12_00 and CKINI_12_00 are related, there could still b...
