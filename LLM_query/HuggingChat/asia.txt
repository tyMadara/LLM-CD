Causal inference can be challenging without further context about the population under study and potential confounding factors. However, here's my attempt at analyzing the direction of edges based solely on the meaning of the variables:

<edge>visit_to_asia->tuberculosis</edge>: If someone has recently traveled to Asia and contracted TB during that trip, then this edge exists directly. This assumes that there was exposure to infected individuals while traveling in Asia that caused subsequent diagnosis of TB. Note that this may also apply to those exposed before the visit.
<edge>visit_to_asia->lung_cancer</edge>: There might exist several links that could explain this edge. For example, increased air pollution in Asian countries could increase incidence/prevalence of lung cancer. Also, there could be genetic factors more prevalent among Asian populations than others. Finally, it is likely some people would develop lung disease post their trip to Asia (though we don't know when after the trip), making this edge uncertain.
<edge>smoking->lung_cancer</edge>: Smokers have a higher likelihood to develop lung cancer compared to non-smokers. Therefore, there is a direct causation link between smoking and developing lung cancer. We assume there wasn't prior lung cancer in such cases where the individual developed lung cancer due to past smoking behavior.
<edge>either_turb_or_lung_cancer->bronchitis</edge>: It seems less plausible that bronchitis led to either not having tb nor lc (both were absent initially). So reversing this edge looks better. An explanation involving reverse causation like "TB or LC causes Bronchitis" cannot be ruled out, so uncertainty remains regarding direction of relationship. As a result, this edge should not be considered reliable.
<edge>bronchitis->lung_cancer</edge>: Although both conditions involve respiratory system and chest pain, it is unlikely that one leads to another by itself (i.e., Bronchitis->Lung Cancer). Hence, this arrow doesn't appear valid.
<edge>positive_xray->lung_cancer</edge>: A positive x-ray usually implies some issue w
