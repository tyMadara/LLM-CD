The variables C_NI_12_00, C_NI_12_15, C_NI_12_30, and C_NI_12_45 represent the concentration of nitrogen inorganic ions for different time periods. The variables CKNI_12_00, CKNI_12_15, CKNI_12_30, and CKNI_12_45 represent the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen inorganic (CKNI) ions at the same time periods as above. The variables CBODD_12_00, CBODD_12_15, CBODD_12_30, and CBODD_12_45 represent the carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD) for degradable organic matter at the specified time periods. The variables CNOD_12_00, CNOD_12_15, CNOD_12_30, and CNOD_12_45 represent the concentration of nitrogenous oxygen demand (CNOD) at the specified time periods. The variables CBODN_12_00, CBODN_12_15, CBODN_12_30, and CBODN_12_45 represent the carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand for nitrogenous (CBODN) matter at the specified time periods. The variables CKNN_12_00, CKNN_12_15, CKNN_12_30, and CKNN_12_45 represent the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen non-degradable (CKNN) ions at the specified time periods. The variables CNON_12_00, CNON_12_15, CNON_12_30, and CNON_12_45 represent the concentration of nitrogenous non-degradable organic nitrogen (CNON) at the specified time periods.The variable CNI can be directly influenced by variable CKNI as they both measure the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen inorganic ions. Therefore, if there is an increase in the concentration of CKNI in the wastewater system, there will also be an increase in the concentration of CNI.The variable CBOD can be directly influenced by variable CBODN as they both measure the carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand for nitrogenous (CBODN) matter. Therefore, if there is an increase in the concentration of CBODN in the wastewater system, there will also be an increase in the concentration of CBOD.The variable CNOD can be directly influenced by variable CBODN as they both measure the concentration of nitrogenous oxygen demand (CNOD). Therefore, if there is an increase in the concentration of CBODN in the wastewater system, there will also be an increase in the concentration of CNOD.The variable CNO can be directly influenced by variable CBODN as they both measure the concentration of nitrogenous non-degradable organic nitrogen (CNON). Therefore, if there is an increase in the concentration of CBODN in the wastewater system, there will also be an increase in the concentration of CNO.
