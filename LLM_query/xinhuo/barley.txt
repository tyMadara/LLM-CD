The following are the cause-and-effect relationships between the variables in your field:<edge>jordtype->potnmin</edge>: Soil type can affect the potential mineral nitrogen content in the soil, which in turn affects the mineral nitrogen content in the grain. For example, sandy soils may have lower potential mineral nitrogen content than clay soils.komm->nedbarea</edge>: Community or municipality can affect the precipitation area, which in turn affects the availability of water for growing malt. Communities with higher precipitation areas may have more water available for malt production.aar_mod->forfrugt</edge>: The year modifier can affect the preceding crop, which in turn affects the type of crops that are grown before malt. For example, a year with a high modifier may lead to a shift towards crops that require less fertilizer and pesticides.jordn->pesticid</edge>: Soil nitrogen content can affect the use of pesticides, as higher nitrogen content may reduce the need for chemical control measures.exptgens->ngodnt</edge>: Experimental yield loss percentage can affect the optimal nitrogen treatment, as higher experimental yield loss percentage may require more nitrogen to achieve optimal grain yield.
