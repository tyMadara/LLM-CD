<edge>Smoker->Cancer</edge>: Smokers are at a higher risk of developing cancer than non-smokers. This is because smoking causes damage to the DNA in cells, which can lead to mutations and increase the risk of cancer.Pollution->Cancer</edge>: High levels of air pollution have been linked to an increased risk of cancer, especially lung cancer. Exposure to pollutants can cause inflammation and damage to tissues, leading to the development of cancerous growths.Xray->Cancer</edge>: A positive X-ray result may be indicative of cancer, as it can show the presence of tumors or other abnormalities in the body. However, a negative X-ray result does not necessarily rule out the possibility of cancer, as many types of cancer do not show up on X-rays until later stages of disease.Dyspnea->Cancer</edge>: Dyspnea is a symptom of respiratory problems, including lung cancer. As such, individuals experiencing dyspnea may be more likely to have underlying lung cancer that is causing their symptoms.
