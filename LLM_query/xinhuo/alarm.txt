<edge>HISTORY->HYPOVOLEMIA</edge>: If a patient has a significant medical history related to the current condition, it can lead to hypovolemia.CVP -> LVEDVOLUME: The pressure within the thoracic vena cava is closely linked to the volume of blood in the left ventricle at end-diastole. This relationship suggests that if the CVP is high, there may be less blood in the left ventricle, leading to a decrease in LVEDVOLUME.PCWP -> LVFAILURE: The pressure in the pulmonary capillaries reflects the pressure in the left atrium, which is linked to left ventricular failure. If there is low pressure in the pulmonary capillaries, it can indicate that the left ventricular function is impaired, leading to LVFAILURE.STROKEVOLUME -> CO: The amount of blood pumped out of the heart with each beat is directly related to cardiac output. A decrease in stroke volume can result in a decrease in cardiac output.ERRLOWOUTPUT -> HRBP: Errors in measuring cardiac output can lead to falsely low readings, which can affect the measurement of heart rate and blood pressure.HRBP -> HRSAT: High or low heart rate and blood pressure can affect oxygen saturation, as well as the patient's level of anesthesia.INSUFFANESTH -> CATECHOL: Insufficient anesthesia can affect levels of catecholamines, which are involved in regulating heart rate and blood pressure.ANAPHYLAXIS -> TPR: Anaphylaxis can increase total peripheral resistance, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and reduced oxygen saturation.TPR -> CO: Total peripheral resistance affects blood flow within the circulatory system, which can impact cardiac output.CATECHOL -> HR: Levels of catecholamines affect heart rate, as they play a role in regulating this variable.HR -> BP: Heart rate and blood pressure are closely linked, as changes in one can impact the other.
<edge>EXPCO2->FIO2</edge>: The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the exhaled air is known to decrease with increasing inspired oxygen (O2) partial pressure. Therefore, a decrease in EXPCO2 would lead to an increase in FIO2.MINVOL->PRESS</edge>: The volume of gas inhaled or exhaled by the patient in one minute is directly proportional to the pressure in various parts of the respiratory system or related equipment. Therefore, a decrease in MINVOL would lead to a decrease in PRESS.MINVOLSET->PRESS</edge>: The target minute volume set on the ventilator is also directly proportional to the pressure in various parts of the respiratory system or related equipment. Therefore, a decrease in MINVOLSET would lead to a decrease in PRESS.PULMEMBOLUS->SAO2</edge>: Pulmonary embolism can cause a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation (SAO2).Therefore, PULMEMBOLUS->SAO2.SHUNT->PRESS</edge>: A shunt can cause a decrease in pressure in various parts of the respiratory system or related equipment.Therefore, SHUNT->PRESS.DISCONNECT->PRESS</edge>: A disconnection in the patient's ventilator circuit can cause a decrease in pressure in various parts of the respiratory system or related equipment.Therefore, DISCONNECT->PRESS.VENTTUBE->VENTMACH</edge>: The patency or status of the ventilator tube can affect the performance or status of the ventilator machine. Therefore, VENTTUBE->VENTMACH.VENTTLUNG->VENTMACH</edge>: The functioning or status of the patient's lungs while on a ventilator can affect the performance or status of the ventilator machine. Therefore, VENTTLUNG->VENTMACH.VENTTALV->VENTMACH</edge>: The functioning or status of the patient's alveoli while on a ventilator can affect the performance or status of the ventilator machine. Therefore, VENTTALV->VENTMACH.ARTCO2->FIO2</edge>: The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the arterial blood is known to decrease with increasing inspired oxygen (O2) partial pressure. Therefore, a decrease in ARTCO2 would lead to an increase in FIO2.
