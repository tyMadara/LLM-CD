<edge>BirthAsphyxia->HypDistrib</edge>: Birth asphyxia can cause changes in the distribution of blood flow in the body, leading to hypodistrib.HypoxiaInO2->CO2</edge>: Hypoxia, or low oxygen levels, can lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide levels in the body.CO2->HypoxiaInO2</edge>: High carbon dioxide levels can lead to increased hypoxia (low oxygen levels) in the body.HypoxiaInO2->ChestXray</edge>: Hypoxia can be indicated by changes in the appearance of chest X-rays findings.ChestXray->HypoxiaInO2</edge>: Chest X-rays can show signs of hypoxia if there is an increase in the severity of hypoxia.HypoxiaInO2->Grunting</edge>: Grunting can be a sign of hypoxia in newborns.LVHreport->Disease</edge>: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) can be indicative of certain diseases that the newborn may be diagnosed with.LowerBodyO2->CO2Report</edge>: Lower oxygen saturation levels in the lower body can indicate high CO2 levels in the body.RUQO2->CO2Report</edge>: Right upper quadrant oxygen saturation levels can indicate high CO2 levels in the body.CO2Report->HypoxiaInO2</edge>: High CO2 levels can lead to increased hypoxia (low oxygen levels) in the body.XrayReport->Disease</edge>: Chest X-rays can show signs of disease if there is an increase in the severity of hypoxia.Disease->GruntingReport</edge>: Certain diseases that newborns may be diagnosed with can also lead to grunting.Age->Disease</edge>: The age of the newborn can be an indicator of certain diseases they may be more susceptible to developing.LVH->Disease</edge>: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) can be indicative of certain diseases that the newborn may be diagnosed with.DuctFlow->CardiacMixing</edge>: Changes in ductus arteriosus direction can affect the degree of mixing between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the heart.CardiacMixing->Sick</edge>: The degree of mixing between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the heart can be an indicator of whether the newborn is sick or not.
