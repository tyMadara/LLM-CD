The variables in this domain are related to wastewater treatment and its control systems. They represent different parameters that are typically measured in the wastewater treatment process. Here is a brief explanation of each variable:

C_NI_12_00, C_NI_12_15, C_NI_12_30, C_NI_12_45: These variables represent the concentration of nickel (Ni) in the wastewater at four different sampling times, i.e., 12:00, 12:15, 12:30, and 12:45, respectively. The concentration is given as a discrete value, which can take one of four possible values: 3, 4, 5, or 6.

CKNI_12_00, CKNI_12_15, CKNI_12_30, CKNI_12_45: These variables represent the control limits for nickel concentration at the same four sampling times. The control limits are given as a discrete value, which can take one of three possible values: 20 mg/L, 30 mg/L, or 40 mg/L.

CBODD_12_00, CBODD_12_15, CBODD_12_30, CBODD_12_45: These variables represent the concentration of biodegradable organic matter, measured as the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), in the wastewater at the four sampling times. The concentration is given as a discrete value, which can take one of four possible values: 15 mg/L, 20 mg/L, 25 mg/L, or 30 mg/L.

CKND_12_00, CKND_12_15, CKND_12_30, CKND_12_45: These variables represent the control limits for the concentration of total nitrogen (N) in the wastewater at the four sampling times. The concentration is given as a discrete value, which can take one of three possible values: 2 mg/L, 4 mg/L, or 6 mg/L.

CNOD_12_00, CNOD_12_15, CNOD_12_30, CNOD_12_45: These variables represent the concentration of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) in the wastewater at the four sampling times. The concentration is given as a discrete value, which can take one of four possible values: 0.5 mg/L, 1 mg/L, 2 mg/L, or 4 mg/L.

CBODN_12_00, CBODN_12_15, CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_45: These variables represent the concentration of biodegradable organic matter and total nitrogen (BOD:N) in the wastewater at the four sampling times. The concentration is given as a discrete value, which can take one of four possible values: 5 mg/L, 10 mg/L, 15 mg/L, or 20 mg/L.

CKNN_12_00, CKNN_12_15, CKNN_12_30, CKNN_12_45: These variables represent the control limits for the concentration of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) in the wastewater at the four sampling times. The concentration is given as a discrete value, which can take one of three possible values: 0.5 mg/L, 1 mg/L, or 2 mg/L.

CNON_12_00, CNON_12_15, CNON_12_30, CNON_12_45: These variables represent the concentration of nitrite-nitrogen (NO2-N) in the wastewater at the four sampling times. The concentration is given as a discrete value, which can take one of four possible values: 2 mg/L, 4 mg/L, 6 mg/L, or 10 mg/L.

Based on the meaning of variables you provide, analyze the cause-and-effect relationships between them.
Please give the results as a directed graph network in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>.
Make sure that each edge represent a direct causality between the two variables.
```

```
Based on the meaning of the variables, the cause-and-effect relationships between them can be represented as follows:
<edge>C_NI_12_00->CKNI_12_00</edge>
<edge>C_NI_12_15->CKNI_12_15</edge>
<edge>C_NI_12_30->CKNI_12_30</edge>
<edge>C_NI_12_45->CKNI_12_45</edge>
<edge>CBODD_12_00->CKND_12_00</edge>
<edge>CBODD_12_15->CKND_12_15</edge>
<edge>CBODD_12_30->CKND_12_30</edge>
<edge>CBODD_12_45->CKND_12_45</edge>
<edge>CKND_12_00->CNOD_12_00</edge>
<edge>CKND_12_15->CNOD_12_15</edge>
<edge>CKND_12_30->CNOD_12_30</edge>
<edge>CKND_12_45->CNOD_12_45</edge>
<edge>CBODN_12_00->CKNN_12_00</edge>
<edge>CBODN_12_15->CKNN_12_15</edge>
<edge>CBODN_12_30->CKNN_12_30</edge>
<edge>CBODN_12_45->CKNN_12_45</edge>
<edge>CKNN_12_00->CNON_12_00</edge>
<edge>CKNN_12_15->CNON_12_15</edge>
<edge>CKNN_12_30->CNON_12_30</edge>
<edge>CKNN_12_45->CNON_12_45</edge>
In this directed graph network, each edge represents a direct causality between two variables, where the arrow points from the cause variable to the effect variable. For example, the edge C_NI_12_00->CKNI_12_00 indicates that the concentration of nickel at 12:00 can cause the control limits for nickel concentration at 12:00 to change. Similarly, the edge CBODD_12_00->CKND_12_00 indicates that the concentration of biodegradable organic matter at 12:00 can cause the control limits for total nitrogen concentration at 12:00 to change.
