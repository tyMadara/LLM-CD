Analyze the causality between each pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.
```

```
As an AI language model, I can provide an analytical approach to identify possible causal relationships between variables based on statistical data or domain knowledge. However, it is important to note that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, and causality cannot be inferred solely from observational data. Therefore, the causality between each pair of variables cannot be determined with certainty without additional domain knowledge or experimental data.

That being said, based on the given variable descriptions, here are some possible causal relationships between the variables:

<edge>jordtype->ngodnt</edge>: The type of soil may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the malt plants, as different soil types may have different nutrient availability and retention capacities.
<edge>komm->ngodnt</edge>: The geographical location of the field may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the malt plants, as different regions may have different soil and climate conditions that affect nutrient uptake and utilization by the plants.
<edge>nedbarea->ngodnt</edge>: The annual precipitation in the area may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the malt plants, as water availability can affect nutrient uptake and plant growth.
<edge>nmin->ngodnt</edge>: The amount of nitrogen in the soil may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the malt plants, as nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development.
<edge>aar_mod->ngodnt</edge>: The age of the malt plants may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the plants, as nutrient requirements and uptake may vary throughout the growth stages.
<edge>forfrugt->ngodnt</edge>: The type of crop grown before the malt may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the malt plants, as different crops may have different nutrient demands and may affect the nutrient availability in the soil.
<edge>potnmin->ngodnt</edge>: The potential nitrogen supply in the soil may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the malt plants, as it represents the maximum amount of nitrogen that could be available to the plants.
<edge>jordn->ngodnt</edge>: The depth of the soil layer in which the majority of the roots of the malt plants are located may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the malt plants, as nutrient availability and uptake can vary with soil depth.
<edge>pesticid->ngodnt</edge>: The use of pesticides may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the malt plants, as pesticides may affect soil microbial activity and nutrient availability.
<edge>exptgens->ngodnt</edge>: The expected harvest time of the malt may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the plants, as nutrient requirements and uptake may vary throughout the growth stages.
<edge>mod_nmin->ngodnt</edge>: The modified amount of nitrogen in the soil may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the malt plants, as it represents the actual amount of nitrogen available to the plants after accounting for losses and other factors.
<edge>ngodnn->ngodnt</edge>: The optimal amount of nitrogen in the soil may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the malt plants, as the soil is the primary source of nutrients for the plants.
<edge>nopt->ngodnt</edge>: The optimal nitrogen supply in the soil may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the malt plants, as it represents the amount of nitrogen that should be available in the soil for optimal plant growth.
<edge>ngodn->ngodnt</edge>: The optimal total amount of nitrogen in the malt and the soil may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the malt plants, as it represents the balance between soil and plant nitrogen status.
<edge>nprot->ngodnt</edge>: The optimal amount of protein in the malt may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the plants, as protein synthesis requires nitrogen as a building block.
<edge>saatid->ngodnt</edge>: The sowing time of the malt may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the plants, as nutrient requirements and uptake may vary throughout the growth stages.
<edge>rokap->ngodnt</edge>: The row spacing in the field may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the plants, as it may affect nutrient availability and uptake by the plants.
<edge>dgv1059->ngodnt</edge>: The expected yield of the malt may affect the optimal amount of nitrogen in the plants, as nutrient requirements and uptake may vary with yield.
