You are an expert on assessing the impact of tuberculosis, lung cancer or bronchitis on the shortness-of-breath (dyspnoea).
You are investigating the cause-and-effect relationships between the following variables in your filed.
Variable abbreviations and values are presented as follows.
Please understand the real meaning of each variable according to their possible values, and explain them in order.

network unknown {
}
variable visit_to_asia {
type discrete [ 2 ] { yes, no };
}
variable tuberculosis {
type discrete [ 2 ] { yes, no };
}
variable smoking {
type discrete [ 2 ] { yes, no };
}
variable lung_cancer {
type discrete [ 2 ] { yes, no };
}
variable bronchitis {
type discrete [ 2 ] { yes, no };
}
variable either_turb_or_lung_cancer {
type discrete [ 2 ] { yes, no };
}
variable positive_xray {
type discrete [ 2 ] { yes, no };
}
variable dyspnoea {
type discrete [ 2 ] { yes, no };
}
```

```
The variables represent the following:

visit_to_asia: Whether the patient has visited Asia, coded as yes or no

tuberculosis: Whether the patient has tuberculosis, coded as yes or no

smoking: Whether the patient smokes, coded as yes or no

lung_cancer: Whether the patient has lung cancer, coded as yes or no

bronchitis: Whether the patient has bronchitis, coded as yes or no

either_turb_or_lung_cancer: Whether the patient has either tuberculosis or lung cancer, coded as yes or no

positive_xray: Whether the patient has an abnormal chest x-ray, coded as yes or no

dyspnoea: Whether the patient has shortness of breath (dyspnoea), coded as yes or no

So in summary, these variables relate to risk factors and conditions that could potentially cause or contribute to shortness of breath. You're investigating the relationships between these variables and dyspnoea.
```

```
Analyze the causality between each pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.
```

```
<edge>tuberculosis->dyspnoea</edge>
Reason: Tuberculosis can directly cause shortness of breath.

<edge>lung_cancer->dyspnoea</edge>
Reason: Lung cancer can directly cause shortness of breath.

<edge>bronchitis->dyspnoea</edge>
Reason: Bronchitis can directly cause shortness of breath.

<edge>either_turb_or_lung_cancer->dyspnoea</edge>
Reason: Either tuberculosis or lung cancer can directly cause shortness of breath.

<edge>positive_xray->dyspnoea</edge>
Reason: An abnormal chest x-ray could indicate a condition that directly causes shortness of breath.

<edge>smoking->lung_cancer</edge>
Reason: Smoking can directly cause lung cancer.

<edge>visit_to_asia->tuberculosis</edge>
Reason: Visiting areas with high tuberculosis rates can directly lead to tuberculosis infection.
