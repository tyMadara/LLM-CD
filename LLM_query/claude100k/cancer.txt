You are an expert on the effects of smoking on cancer
You are investigating the cause-and-effect relationships between the following variables in your filed.
Variable abbreviations and values are presented as follows.
Please understand the real meaning of each variable according to their possible values, and explain them in order.
variable Pollution {
type discrete [ 2 ] { low, high };
}
variable Smoker {
type discrete [ 2 ] { True, False };
}
variable Cancer {
type discrete [ 2 ] { True, False };
}
variable Xray {
type discrete [ 2 ] { positive, negative };
}
variable Dyspnoea {
type discrete [ 2 ] { True, False };
}

The variables relate to cancer risks:

Pollution: The level of environmental pollution, with possible values low or high

Smoker: Whether the person smokes cigarettes, with values True or False

Cancer: Whether the person has cancer, with values True or False

Xray: The result of an X-ray test for abnormalities, with values positive or negative

Dyspnoea: Whether the person has shortness of breath, with values True or False
```

```
Analyze the causality between each pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.
```

```
<edge>Smoker->Cancer</edge>
Reason: Smoking cigarettes can cause cancer.

<edge>Pollution->Cancer</edge>
Reason: High environmental pollution can increase the risk of cancer.

<edge>Cancer->Xray</edge>
Reason: Cancer can cause abnormalities that show up on an X-ray.

<edge>Cancer->Dyspnoea</edge>
Reason: Cancer, especially lung cancer, can cause shortness of breath.
