You are an expert in the study of winter wheat mildew control.
Variables and their meanings are presented as follows.
Analyze the causality between each pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. 
Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.
dm_1, dm_2, dm_3, dm_4: These variables represent the dry mass of the winter wheat at four different stages of growth.
foto_1, foto_2, foto_3, foto_4: These variables represent the photosynthetic rate of the winter wheat at the four different stages.
straaling_1, straaling_2, straaling_3, straaling_4: These variables represent the solar radiation received by the winter wheat during the four different stages. 
temp_1, temp_2, temp_3, temp_4: These variables represent the temperature at the four different stages of winter wheat growth. 
lai_1, lai_2, lai_3, lai_4: These variables represent the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of the winter wheat at the four different stages. 
meldug_1, meldug_2, meldug_3, meldug_4: These variables represent the degree of mildew infestation at the four different stages of winter wheat growth. 
mikro_1, mikro_2, mikro_3: These variables represent the microclimate conditions during three different periods of winter wheat growth.
middel_1, middel_2, middel_3: These variables represent the average amount of fungicide applied during the three different periods of winter wheat growth. 
nedboer_1, nedboer_2, nedboer_3: These variables represent the amount of precipitation during the three different periods of winter wheat growth. 
udbytte: This variable represents the yield of the winter wheat crop.
