You are an expert on estimating the expected claim costs for a car insurance policyholder.
Variables and their meanings are presented as follows.
Analyze the causality between each pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. 
Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.
GoodStudent: Indicates if the policyholder is a good student or not.
Age: Categorizes the policyholder's age group.
SocioEcon: Represents the policyholder's socioeconomic status.
RiskAversion: Describes the policyholder's risk aversion level.
VehicleYear: Indicates the recency of the policyholder's vehicle.
ThisCarDam: Describes the extent of damage to the policyholder's vehicle.
RuggedAuto: Represents the ruggedness of the policyholder's vehicle.
Accident: Describes the severity of the policyholder's accident.
MakeModel: Indicates the make and model of the policyholder's vehicle.
DrivQuality: Represents the quality of the policyholder's driving.
Mileage: Categorizes the policyholder's vehicle mileage.
Antilock: Indicates if the policyholder's vehicle has antilock brakes.
DrivingSkill: Represents the policyholder's driving skill level.
SeniorTrain: Indicates if the senior policyholder has received specialized driving training.
ThisCarCost: Describes the cost of the policyholder's vehicle.
Theft: Indicates if the policyholder's vehicle has been stolen.
CarValue: Represents the value of the policyholder's vehicle.
HomeBase: Describes the policyholder's home location security level.
AntiTheft: Indicates if the policyholder's vehicle has an anti-theft system.
PropCost: Represents the cost of property damage, if any, caused by the policyholder.
OtherCarCost: Describes the cost of damage to other cars, if any, caused by the policyholder.
OtherCar: Indicates if the policyholder has damaged another car.
MedCost: Represents the cost of medical expenses, if any, resulting from the policyholder's accident.
Cushioning: Describes the cushioning quality of the policyholder's vehicle.
Airbag: Indicates if the policyholder's vehicle has airbags.
ILiCost: Represents the cost of injury liability, if any, resulting from the policyholder's accident.
DrivHist: Describes the policyholder's driving history in terms of accidents.

Based on the given variables, the causality relationships between each pair of variables are presented below:


<edge>GoodStudent->ThisCarCost</edge>: Good students are generally responsible and careful, which may reduce the likelihood of accidents, and subsequently, the cost of the car.

<edge>Age->ILiCost</edge>: Older policyholders may have slower reflexes and weaker physical conditions, which may increase the likelihood of accidents and injuries, and hence higher costs.

<edge>SocioEcon->PropCost</edge>: Policyholders with higher socioeconomic status may own more valuable properties, leading to higher property damage costs.

<edge>RiskAversion->Accident</edge>: Risk-averse policyholders may be more cautious and less likely to engage in risky driving behavior, resulting in fewer accidents.

<edge>VehicleYear->ThisCarCost</edge>: Newer vehicles may have higher repair costs in case of accidents, leading to higher expected claim costs.

<edge>ThisCarDam->OtherCarCost</edge>: The extent of damage to the policyholder's vehicle may indicate the severity of the accident, which may result in higher costs for other cars involved in the accident.

<edge>RuggedAuto->ThisCarCost</edge>: Rugged vehicles may have higher repair costs, leading to higher expected claim costs.

<edge>Accident->ILiCost</edge>: The severity of the accident may affect the injury liability costs. More severe accidents may result in higher expected claim costs.

<edge>MakeModel->ThisCarCost</edge>: More expensive vehicles may have higher repair costs, leading to higher expected claim costs.

<edge>DrivQuality->Accident</edge>: Better driving quality may reduce the likelihood of accidents, resulting in lower expected claim costs.

<edge>Mileage->ThisCarCost</edge>: Higher mileage may indicate more wear and tear of the vehicle, leading to higher repair costs and hence higher expected claim costs.

<edge>Antilock->Accident</edge>: Vehicles with antilock brakes may have better control and maneuverability, leading to fewer accidents and lower expected claim costs.

<edge>DrivingSkill->Accident</edge>: Better driving skills may reduce the likelihood of accidents, resulting in lower expected claim costs.

<edge>SeniorTrain->Accident</edge>: Senior drivers who have received specialized driving training may be more cautious and aware of potential risks, resulting in fewer accidents and lower expected claim costs.

<edge>Theft->ThisCarCost</edge>: Vehicles that have been stolen may have incurred damages during the theft, leading to higher expected claim costs.

<edge>CarValue->ThisCarCost</edge>: Higher car value may indicate more expensive parts and repairs, leading to higher expected claim costs.

<edge>HomeBase->ThisCarCost</edge>: Policyholders who live in areas with higher crime rates may have a higher risk of vehicle damage or theft, leading to higher expected claim costs.

<edge>AntiTheft->Theft</edge>: Anti-theft systems may reduce the likelihood of vehicle theft, resulting in lower expected claim costs.

<edge>PropCost->OtherCarCost</edge>: Property damage costs may indicate the severity of the accident, which may result in higher costs for other cars involved in the accident.

<edge>OtherCar->OtherCarCost</edge>: Policyholders who have damaged other cars in the past are more likely to engage in risky driving behavior, resulting in higher expected claim costs.

<edge>MedCost->ILiCost</edge>: Medical expenses resulting from accidents may contribute to injury liability costs. Higher medical costs may lead to higher expected claim costs.

<edge>Cushioning->ILiCost</edge>: Better cushioning quality may reduce the likelihood and severity of injuries, resulting in lower expected claim costs.

<edge>Airbag->ILiCost</edge>: Vehicles with airbags may reduce the likelihood and severity of injuries, resulting in lower expected claim costs.

<edge>DrivHist->Accident</edge>: Policyholders who have had accidents in the past are more likely to engage in risky driving behavior, resulting in higher expected claim costs.
