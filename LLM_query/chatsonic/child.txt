You are an expert on childhood diseases.
Variables and their meanings are presented as follows.
Analyze the causality between each pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. 
Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.
BirthAsphyxia: This variable indicates whether the newborn experienced birth asphyxia or not.
HypDistrib: This variable represents the distribution of blood flow in the body.
HypoxiaInO2: This variable indicates the severity of hypoxia (low oxygen levels) in the body.
CO2: This variable represents the carbon dioxide levels in the body.
ChestXray: This variable describes the appearance of the chest X-ray findings.
Grunting: This variable indicates the presence of grunting in the newborn.
LVHreport: This variable represents the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the medical report.
LowerBodyO2: This variable indicates the oxygen saturation levels in the lower body.
RUQO2: This variable indicates the oxygen saturation levels in the right upper quadrant of the body.
CO2Report: This variable represents the CO2 levels in the medical report.
XrayReport: This variable describes the appearance of the chest X-ray findings in the medical report.
Disease: This variable represents the type of disease the newborn is diagnosed with.
GruntingReport: This variable indicates the presence of grunting in the medical report.
Age: This variable represents the age of the newborn.
LVH: This variable indicates the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the newborn.
DuctFlow: This variable represents the direction of blood flow in the ductus arteriosus.
CardiacMixing: This variable describes the degree of mixing between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the heart.
LungParench: This variable represents the appearance of the lung parenchyma.
LungFlow: This variable indicates the blood flow in the lungs.
Sick: This variable indicates whether the newborn is sick or not.

Based on the variables presented, the causality between each pair of variables can be analyzed as follows:


<edge>BirthAsphyxia->HypDistrib</edge>:
: Birth asphyxia can cause decreased blood flow distribution in the body.

<edge>HypoxiaInO2->CO2</edge>:
: Hypoxia can cause an increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the body.

<edge>ChestXray->XrayReport</edge>:
: The appearance of chest X-ray findings can be described in the medical report.

<edge>Grunting->GruntingReport</edge>:
: The presence of grunting can be indicated in the medical report.

<edge>LVH->LVHreport</edge>:
: The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) can be represented in the medical report.

<edge>LowerBodyO2->RUQO2</edge>:
: Oxygen saturation levels in the lower body can be different from those in the right upper quadrant of the body.

<edge>CO2Report->CO2</edge>:
: The CO2 levels can be represented in the medical report.

<edge>XrayReport->Disease</edge>:
: The appearance of chest X-ray findings can be used to diagnose the type of disease.

<edge>Age->Disease</edge>:
: The age of the newborn can be a factor in determining the type of disease.

<edge>BirthAsphyxia->Grunting</edge>:
: Birth asphyxia can cause the presence of grunting in the newborn.

<edge>LVH->DuctFlow</edge>:
: The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) can affect the direction of blood flow in the ductus arteriosus.

<edge>CardiacMixing->HypoxiaInO2</edge>:
: The degree of mixing between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the heart can affect the severity of hypoxia (low oxygen levels) in the body.

<edge>LungParench->LungFlow</edge>:
: The appearance of the lung parenchyma can affect the blood flow in the lungs.

<edge>Sick->BirthAsphyxia</edge>:
: Being sick can increase the risk of experiencing birth asphyxia.
