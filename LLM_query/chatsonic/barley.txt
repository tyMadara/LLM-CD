You are an expert in designing decision support systems for growing malt without the use of pesticides.
Variables and their meanings are presented as follows.
Analyze the causality between each pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.
jordtype: Soil type. This variable represents the different soil types
komm: Community or municipality.
nedbarea: Precipitation area.
nmin: Mineral nitrogen content in the soil 
aar_mod: Year modifier. 
forfrugt: Preceding crop. 
potnmin: Potential mineral nitrogen content in the soil.
pesticid: Pesticide usage. 
exptgens: Experimental yield loss percentage.
mod_nmin: Modified mineral nitrogen content in the soil.
ngodnt: Nitrogen content in the grain at optimal nitrogen treatment .
nopt: Optimal nitrogen content .
ngodnn: Nitrogen content in the grain at non-optimal nitrogen treatment .
ngodn: Nitrogen content in the grain.
nprot: Nitrogen content in the protein.
saatid: Sowing date.
rokap: Rooting capacity.
dgv1059: Grain yield at 10.5% moisture content.
```

```
Based on the variables provided, the causality relationships are as follows:


<edge>jordtype->nmin</edge>:
: Soil type can impact the mineral nitrogen content in the soil.

<edge>nedbarea->dgv1059</edge>:
: Precipitation area can impact the grain yield at 10.5% moisture content.

<edge>forfrugt->mod_nmin</edge>:
: The preceding crop can impact the modified mineral nitrogen content in the soil.

<edge>mod_nmin->ngodnt</edge>:
: The modified mineral nitrogen content in the soil can impact the nitrogen content in the grain at optimal nitrogen treatment.

<edge>mod_nmin->nopt</edge>:
: The modified mineral nitrogen content in the soil can impact the optimal nitrogen content.

<edge>mod_nmin->ngodnn</edge>:
: The modified mineral nitrogen content in the soil can impact the nitrogen content in the grain at non-optimal nitrogen treatment.

<edge>ngodnt->nprot</edge>:
: The nitrogen content in the grain at optimal nitrogen treatment can impact the nitrogen content in the protein.

<edge>nprot->dgv1059</edge>:
: The nitrogen content in the protein can impact the grain yield at 10.5% moisture content.

<edge>saatid->rokap</edge>:
: The sowing date can impact the rooting capacity.

It's important to note that these causality relationships are based on the given variables and may not represent the complete picture of factors impacting malt growth without the use of pesticides.
