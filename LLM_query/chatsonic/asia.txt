You are an expert on assessing the impact of tuberculosis, lung cancer or bronchitis on the shortness-of-breath (dyspnoea).
Variables and their meanings are presented as follows.
You are investigating the cause-and-effect relationships between the following variables in your filed.
Analyze the causality between each pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. 
Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.

visit_to_asia: This variable indicates whether the person has recently visited Asia or not.
tuberculosis: This variable indicates whether the person has tuberculosis or not.
smoking: This variable indicates whether the person is a smoker or not.
lung_cancer: This variable indicates whether the person has lung cancer or not.
bronchitis: This variable indicates whether the person has bronchitis or not. 
either_turb_or_lung_cancer: This variable indicates whether the person has either tuberculosis or lung cancer or not.
positive_xray: This variable indicates whether the person has a positive X-ray result or not. 
dyspnoea: This variable indicates whether the person is experiencing shortness of breath (dyspnoea) or not. 
```

```
The causality between the variables is as follows:
<edge>visit_to_asia->tuberculosis</edge>: Recent visit to Asia is a known risk factor for tuberculosis [1].
<edge>tuberculosis->positive_xray</edge>: A positive X-ray is a common diagnostic tool for tuberculosis [1].
<edge>smoking->lung_cancer</edge>: Smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer [1].
<edge>smoking->bronchitis</edge>: Smoking is a known cause of bronchitis [1].
<edge>tuberculosis->either_turb_or_lung_cancer</edge>: Tuberculosis is a known risk factor for both tuberculosis and lung cancer [2].
<edge>lung_cancer->positive_xray</edge>: A positive X-ray is a common diagnostic tool for lung cancer [1].
<edge>either_turb_or_lung_cancer->dyspnoea</edge>: Both tuberculosis and lung cancer can cause shortness of breath (dyspnoea) [1].
