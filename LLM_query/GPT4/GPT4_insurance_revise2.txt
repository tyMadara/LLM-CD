Analyze the causality between at least 15 pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>. Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.

Here are 15 pairs of variables with direct causality:

<edge>Age->DrivingSkill</edge>: Age can directly affect driving skills as younger or older drivers may have different skill levels compared to middle-aged drivers.
<edge>GoodStudent->DrivingSkill</edge>: Being a good student can be correlated with better driving skills due to better discipline and learning habits.
<edge>DrivingSkill->DrivQuality</edge>: Driving skill directly affects the quality of driving, with higher skills usually leading to better driving quality.
<edge>MakeModel->CarValue</edge>: The make and model of a car directly affect its value; more expensive models have higher values.
<edge>VehicleYear->CarValue</edge>: The age of a vehicle directly affects its value, with older vehicles generally having lower values.
<edge>Mileage->ThisCarDam</edge>: Higher mileage can directly contribute to increased wear and tear, potentially leading to more damage to the car.
<edge>Antilock->Accident</edge>: The presence of antilock brakes can directly affect the likelihood of accidents, as they can help prevent skidding and loss of control.
<edge>SeniorTrain->DrivingSkill</edge>: Senior driver training can directly improve driving skills for seniors.
<edge>RiskAversion->DrivQuality</edge>: Risk aversion can directly affect driving quality, with more cautious drivers generally exhibiting better driving quality.
<edge>DrivQuality->Accident</edge>: Driving quality directly affects the likelihood of accidents, with poor driving quality increasing the chances of accidents.
<edge>Accident->PropCost</edge>: The severity of an accident directly affects the cost of property damage.
<edge>Accident->MedCost</edge>: The severity of an accident directly affects the medical costs associated with injuries.
<edge>Theft->CarValue</edge>: Car theft directly affects the car's value, as a stolen car will have a lower value or no value.
<edge>AntiTheft->Theft</edge>: The presence of an anti-theft device can directly decrease the likelihood of car theft.
<edge>HomeBase->Theft</edge>: The policyholder's home location can directly affect the likelihood of car theft, as certain locations may have higher or lower theft rates.
These causal relationships represent direct links between variables that can help estimate the expected claim costs for a car insurance policyholder.
