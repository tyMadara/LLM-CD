Analyze the causality between each pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.

Below, I have provided causal relationships between some of the variables, in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, along with reasons for the causality. Since there are many variables, I will focus on the most relevant direct causality relationships.

<edge>HYPOVOLEMIA->CVP</edge>: Hypovolemia causes a decrease in blood volume, leading to low central venous pressure (CVP).
<edge>HYPOVOLEMIA->LVEDVOLUME</edge>: Hypovolemia causes a decrease in blood volume, resulting in a low left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDVOLUME).
<edge>LVEDVOLUME->STROKEVOLUME</edge>: The left ventricular end-diastolic volume directly impacts the stroke volume; a low LVEDVOLUME can cause a low stroke volume.
<edge>LVFAILURE->PCWP</edge>: Left ventricular failure can lead to an increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) due to blood backing up in the pulmonary circulation.
<edge>STROKEVOLUME->CO</edge>: Stroke volume is a component of cardiac output (CO); a low stroke volume leads to low cardiac output.
<edge>CO->BP</edge>: Cardiac output has a direct effect on blood pressure (BP); low cardiac output can cause low blood pressure.
<edge>CO->HR</edge>: A decrease in cardiac output can lead to a compensatory increase in heart rate (HR) as the body tries to maintain adequate blood flow.
<edge>ANAPHYLAXIS->TPR</edge>: Anaphylaxis can cause a decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR) due to widespread vasodilation.
<edge>ANAPHYLAXIS->CATECHOL</edge>: Anaphylaxis can cause an increase in catecholamine levels as the body tries to counteract the effects of anaphylaxis.
<edge>INSUFFANESTH->HR</edge>: Insufficient anesthesia can lead to an increase in heart rate due to pain or stress.
<edge>FIO2->SAO2</edge>: The fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) impacts arterial oxygen saturation (SAO2); low FIO2 can result in low SAO2.
<edge>SAO2->PVSAT</edge>: Arterial oxygen saturation (SAO2) influences peripheral venous oxygen saturation (PVSAT); low SAO2 can lead to low PVSAT.
<edge>PULMEMBOLUS->PAP</edge>: A pulmonary embolism can cause an increase in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) due to obstruction of blood flow in the pulmonary circulation.
<edge>INTUBATION->VENTLUNG</edge>: Improper intubation (e.g., esophageal or one-sided) can result in reduced ventilator lung function.
<edge>KINKEDTUBE->MINVOL</edge>: A kinked ventilator tube can lead to reduced minute ventilation (MINVOL).
<edge>DISCONNECT->VENTMACH</edge>: A disconnected ventilator will result in no ventilator machine function (VENTMACH = ZERO).
Please note that not all possible causal relationships have been included, and the list mainly focuses on direct causality. In reality, there may be additional direct and indirect causal relationships between the variables.
