Based on the provided variables, these are related to wastewater treatment control systems and water quality. I will provide an explanation for each variable based on their possible values.

C_NI_12_00, C_NI_12_15, C_NI_12_30, C_NI_12_45: These variables seem to represent the number of nitrogen inorganic ions for different time periods (00, 15, 30, and 45 minutes). The values are discrete (3, 4, 5, and 6), and could possibly represent the concentration levels of nitrogen inorganic ions.

CKNI_12_00, CKNI_12_15, CKNI_12_30, CKNI_12_45: These variables represent the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen inorganic (CKNI) ions at the same time periods as above. The values are discrete (20_MG_L, 30_MG_L, and 40_MG_L), indicating concentrations of 20, 30, and 40 mg/L.

CBODD_12_00, CBODD_12_15, CBODD_12_30, CBODD_12_45: These variables represent the carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD) for degradable organic matter at the specified time periods. The values are discrete (15_MG_L, 20_MG_L, 25_MG_L, and 30_MG_L), indicating concentrations of 15, 20, 25, and 30 mg/L.

CKND_12_00, CKND_12_15, CKND_12_30, CKND_12_45: These variables represent the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen degradable (CKND) ions at the specified time periods. The values are discrete (2_MG_L, 4_MG_L, and 6_MG_L), indicating concentrations of 2, 4, and 6 mg/L.

CNOD_12_00, CNOD_12_15, CNOD_12_30, CNOD_12_45: These variables represent the concentration of nitrogenous oxygen demand (CNOD) at the specified time periods. The values are discrete (0_5_MG_L, 1_MG_L, 2_MG_L, and 4_MG_L), indicating concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg/L.

CBODN_12_00, CBODN_12_15, CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_45: These variables represent the carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand for nitrogenous (CBODN) matter at the specified time periods. The values are discrete (5_MG_L, 10_MG_L, 15_MG_L, and 20_MG_L), indicating concentrations of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/L.

CKNN_12_00, CKNN_12_15, CKNN_12_30, CKNN_12_45: These variables represent the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen non-degradable (CKNN) ions at the specified time periods. The values are discrete (0_5_MG_L, 1_MG_L, and 2_MG_L), indicating concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/L.

CNON_12_00, CNON_12_15, CNON_12_30, CNON_12_45: These variables represent the concentration of nitrogenous non-degradable organic nitrogen (CNON) at the specified time periods. The values are discrete (2_MG_L, 4_MG_L, 6_MG_L, and 10_MG_L), indicating concentrations of 2, 4, 6, and 10 mg/L.

In summary, these variables represent different aspects of water quality related to nitrogenous compounds and their degradability at specific time periods during the wastewater treatment process.

Analyze the causality between each pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.

Analyzing causality between each pair of variables is quite complex without the context of a specific system or dataset. However, I can provide some general insights into the relationships between these variables based on the typical behavior of wastewater treatment systems and the nature of the variables themselves. Note that these are general insights and may not apply to every situation.

<edge>CKNI->C_NI</edge>: An increase in the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen inorganic (CKNI) ions may result in an increase in the number of nitrogen inorganic ions (C_NI). This is because CKNI is a measure of total inorganic nitrogen, which includes C_NI.

<edge>CKND->CNOD</edge>: An increase in the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen degradable (CKND) ions may result in an increase in the nitrogenous oxygen demand (CNOD). This is because CKND represents a portion of the nitrogenous compounds that can be degraded, and their degradation will consume oxygen, leading to an increase in CNOD.

<edge>CBODD->CBODN</edge>: An increase in carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand for degradable organic matter (CBODD) may result in an increase in the carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand for nitrogenous matter (CBODN). This is because both CBODD and CBODN are measures of the oxygen demand for organic matter degradation, and an increase in the demand for degradable matter would also affect the demand for nitrogenous matter.

<edge>CKNN->CNON</edge>: An increase in the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen non-degradable (CKNN) ions may result in an increase in the concentration of nitrogenous non-degradable organic nitrogen (CNON). This is because CKNN represents a portion of the nitrogenous compounds that cannot be degraded, which includes CNON.

<edge>CBODD->CNOD</edge>: An increase in carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand for degradable organic matter (CBODD) may result in an increase in the nitrogenous oxygen demand (CNOD). This is because the degradation of organic matter can release nitrogenous compounds, which will consume oxygen during their subsequent degradation, leading to an increase in CNOD.

Please note that these causal relationships are based on general knowledge of wastewater treatment processes and may not be universally valid. The actual relationships in a specific wastewater treatment system could be influenced by various factors, including the design of the treatment process, the composition of the wastewater, and the operational conditions.
