Analyze the causality between each pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.

I will analyze the direct causality between each pair of variables and provide the reasoning.

<edge>jordtype->jordn</edge>: Soil type directly affects soil nitrogen content, as different soil types have varying capacities to hold and supply nitrogen.

<edge>jordtype->potnmin</edge>: Soil type directly affects the potential mineral nitrogen content in the soil, as different soil types have different mineralization rates and nutrient supply potential.

<edge>forfrugt->nmin</edge>: The preceding crop directly affects mineral nitrogen content in the soil, as different crops have different nitrogen uptake and release patterns, impacting the residual nitrogen available for subsequent crops.

<edge>nedbarea->nmin</edge>: Precipitation area directly affects mineral nitrogen content in the soil, as higher precipitation can lead to increased leaching and denitrification, resulting in lower nitrogen availability.

<edge>nmin->jordn</edge>: Mineral nitrogen content in the soil directly affects soil nitrogen content, as higher mineral nitrogen content contributes to higher overall nitrogen in the soil.

<edge>nmin->mod_nmin</edge>: Mineral nitrogen content in the soil directly affects modified mineral nitrogen content, as the modified content is based on the original mineral nitrogen content and adjusted for specific conditions.

<edge>pesticid->exptgens</edge>: Pesticide usage directly affects experimental yield loss percentage, as the use of pesticides can prevent or mitigate pest damage, leading to reduced yield losses.

<edge>potnmin->ngodn</edge>: Potential mineral nitrogen content in the soil directly affects nitrogen content in the grain, as higher potential nitrogen availability in the soil can lead to greater nitrogen uptake by the plant and higher grain nitrogen content.

<edge>ngodnt->nopt</edge>: Nitrogen content in the grain at optimal nitrogen treatment directly affects optimal nitrogen content, as the grain nitrogen content under optimal treatment conditions informs the ideal nitrogen levels for maximizing yield and quality.

<edge>ngodnn->ngodn</edge>: Nitrogen content in the grain at non-optimal nitrogen treatment directly affects nitrogen content in the grain, as it is one of the factors determining the overall nitrogen content in the grain.

<edge>saatid->exptgens</edge>: Sowing date directly affects experimental yield loss percentage, as different sowing dates can result in varying plant growth and development, impacting the crop's susceptibility to pests and diseases, and ultimately influencing yield losses.

<edge>saatid->dgv1059</edge>: Sowing date directly affects grain yield at 10.5% moisture content, as different sowing dates can influence plant growth, development, and maturation rates, impacting the overall grain yield.

<edge>rokap->dgv1059</edge>: Rooting capacity directly affects grain yield at 10.5% moisture content, as higher rooting capacity enables better nutrient and water uptake, leading to increased grain yield.

Please note that some variables may not have direct causal relationships with other variables due to the complex interactions in agricultural systems. The above list considers the most significant direct causal relationships based on the provided variables and their definitions.

Analyze the causality between each pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.

In a decision support system for growing malt without pesticides, it's essential to understand the direct causality between variables. Here are some causal relationships between pairs of variables:

<edge>nplac->ngtilg</edge>: The method of nitrogen placement (nplac) can affect the nitrogen content in the grain at optimal nitrogen treatment (ngtilg). Different placement methods can result in varying levels of nitrogen uptake by the plants.

<edge>nplac->ntilg</edge>: Similarly, the method of nitrogen placement (nplac) can also affect the nitrogen content in the grain at non-optimal nitrogen treatment (ntilg).

<edge>saamng->antplnt</edge>: The average sowing amount per hectare (saamng) directly impacts the average number of plants per square meter (antplnt). A higher sowing amount will generally result in a higher number of plants.

<edge>tkvs->sorttkv</edge>: The thousand kernel weight (tkvs) is used to rank the barley variety based on this trait (sorttkv). A higher thousand kernel weight will result in a higher ranking.

<edge>saakern->aks_m2</edge>: The average number of kernels per square meter (saakern) is directly related to the number of tillers per square meter (aks_m2). More kernels per square meter indicate a higher number of tillers.

<edge>partigerm->jordinf</edge>: The germination percentage of the barley variety (partigerm) may be affected by the percentage of soil infestation by pests or diseases (jordinf). Higher infestation levels can negatively impact germination.

<edge>saamng->aks_vgt</edge>: The average sowing amount per hectare (saamng) can influence the number of vegetative tillers per square meter (aks_vgt). A higher sowing amount may lead to more vegetative tillers.

<edge>keraks->saakern</edge>: The average number of kernels per ear (keraks) can impact the average number of kernels per square meter (saakern). Varieties with more kernels per ear can contribute to higher kernel numbers per square meter.

<edge>srtsize->ksort</edge>: The size of the barley variety (srtsize) can affect the kernel sorting score (ksort). Larger barley varieties may have different kernel sizes and uniformity compared to smaller ones, influencing the sorting score.

<edge>protein->srtprot</edge>: The protein content in the grain (protein) can be used to categorize the protein content of different malt barley varieties (srtprot). Higher protein content results in a different category assignment.

<edge>jordinf->udb</edge>: The percentage of soil infestation by pests or diseases (jordinf) directly impacts the percentage of grain yield that is not usable due to diseases or pests (udb). A higher infestation level will lead to a higher percentage of unusable grain yield.

It's important to note that these causal relationships may not be comprehensive and could be influenced by other factors, such as environmental conditions, soil properties, and management practices. Additionally, some variables may not have direct causality with each other but may still impact the overall system indirectly.

Analyze the causal relationship between the original variable and the newly considered variable in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. Ensure direct causation of outputs, not indirect causation due to common causes.

I apologize, but it seems that I am missing some context about the newly considered variable. Please provide me with the necessary information about this variable so that I can analyze its causal relationship with the original variables.
