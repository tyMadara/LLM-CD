Based on the meaning of variables you provide, analyze the cause-and-effect relationships between them.
Please give the results as a directed graph network in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>.
Make sure that each edge represent a direct causality between the two variables.
```

```
Here is a directed graph network that shows the cause-and-effect relationships between the variables based on their meanings:

lai_0->lai_1->lai_2->lai_3->lai_4

Leaf area index at the beginning of the growing season affects leaf area index at later stages of the growing season
foto_1->lai_1->foto_2->lai_2->foto_3->lai_3->foto_4->lai_4

Photosynthetically active radiation affects leaf area index, and leaf area index affects photosynthetically active radiation at each stage of the growing season
straaling_1->meldug_1->straaling_2->meldug_2->straaling_3->meldug_3->straaling_4->meldug_4

Solar radiation affects mildew disease severity, and mildew disease severity affects solar radiation at each stage of the growing season
temp_1->dm_1->temp_2->dm_2->temp_3->dm_3->temp_4->dm_4

Average temperature affects winter wheat mildew disease per unit area at each stage of the growing season
mikro_1->middel_1->meldug_1

Type and application rate of fungicide treatment affect mildew disease severity
The above graph network represents the cause-and-effect relationships between the variables. The arrows indicate the direction of the causality. For example, the arrow from lai_0 to lai_1 indicates that leaf area index at the beginning of the growing season influences leaf area index at the next stage of the growing season. Similarly, the arrow from foto_1 to lai_1 indicates that photosynthetically active radiation affects leaf area index at the same stage of the growing season.
