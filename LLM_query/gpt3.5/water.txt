Based on the variable abbreviations and their possible values, it seems that these variables are related to the quality and quantity of various wastewater parameters. Here is an explanation of each variable:

C_NI_12_00, C_NI_12_15, C_NI_12_30, C_NI_12_45: Concentration of nickel in the wastewater sample at different sampling times (12:00, 12:15, 12:30, 12:45).
CKNI_12_00, CKNI_12_15, CKNI_12_30, CKNI_12_45: Concentration of total Kjeldahl nitrogen in the wastewater sample at different sampling times (12:00, 12:15, 12:30, 12:45).
CBODD_12_00, CBODD_12_15, CBODD_12_30, CBODD_12_45: Concentration of dissolved biochemical oxygen demand in the wastewater sample at different sampling times (12:00, 12:15, 12:30, 12:45).
CKND_12_00, CKND_12_15, CKND_12_30, CKND_12_45: Concentration of total Kjeldahl nitrogen in the wastewater sample at different sampling times (12:00, 12:15, 12:30, 12:45).
CNOD_12_00, CNOD_12_15, CNOD_12_30, CNOD_12_45: Concentration of nitrate-nitrogen in the wastewater sample at different sampling times (12:00, 12:15, 12:30, 12:45).
CBODN_12_00, CBODN_12_15, CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_45: Concentration of nitrogenous biochemical oxygen demand in the wastewater sample at different sampling times (12:00, 12:15, 12:30, 12:45).
CKNN_12_00, CKNN_12_15, CKNN_12_30, CKNN_12_45: Concentration of ammonium nitrogen in the wastewater sample at different sampling times (12:00, 12:15, 12:30, 12:45).
CNON_12_00, CNON_12_15, CNON_12_30, CNON_12_45: Concentration of nitrite-nitrogen in the wastewater sample at different sampling times (12:00, 12:15, 12:30, 12:45).
Without more information about the specific wastewater treatment system or process being analyzed, it is difficult to establish direct causal relationships between the variables. However, it is possible that some of these variables are interdependent and could influence each other. For example, the concentration of nitrogenous biochemical oxygen demand (CBODN) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (CKNI) may be related, as both are indicators of organic nitrogen in the wastewater. Similarly, the concentration of nitrate-nitrogen (CNOD) and nitrite-nitrogen (CNON) may be related, as nitrite is an intermediate product in the conversion of ammonium to nitrate in the nitrogen cycle. A directed graph network could be constructed to represent these possible relationships, but additional information would be needed to establish causality.

Based on the meaning of variables you provide, analyze the cause-and-effect relationships between them.
Please give the results as a directed graph network in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>.
Make sure that each edge represent a direct causality between the two variables.
```

Without further information about the specific wastewater treatment system or process being analyzed, it is difficult to establish direct causal relationships between the variables. However, based on the possible relationships between the variables mentioned in my previous response, a directed graph network could be constructed to represent the possible causality between these variables.

Here is a possible directed graph network based on the relationships mentioned:

This network suggests that nitrogenous biochemical oxygen demand (CBODN) may have a causal relationship with total Kjeldahl nitrogen (CKNI) and nitrate-nitrogen (CNOD), which in turn may have a causal relationship with nitrite-nitrogen (CNON). Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (CKNI) may also have a causal relationship with total Kjeldahl nitrogen in the dissolved form (CKND), which may in turn have a causal relationship with ammonium nitrogen (CKNN).

Please note that this is just one possible interpretation of the relationships between the variables based on the limited information provided. The actual causal relationships between these variables in a specific wastewater treatment system or process may be different and more complex.
