You are an expert in the study of winter wheat mildew control.
Variables and their meanings are presented as follows.
please remember these variables and their meanings. the next question will use them 
```

```
dm_1, dm_2, dm_3, dm_4: These variables represent the dry mass of the winter wheat at four different stages of growth.
foto_1, foto_2, foto_3, foto_4: These variables represent the photosynthetic rate of the winter wheat at the four different stages.
straaling_1, straaling_2, straaling_3, straaling_4: These variables represent the solar radiation received by the winter wheat during the four different stages. 
temp_1, temp_2, temp_3, temp_4: These variables represent the temperature at the four different stages of winter wheat growth. 
lai_1, lai_2, lai_3, lai_4: These variables represent the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of the winter wheat at the four different stages. 
meldug_1, meldug_2, meldug_3, meldug_4: These variables represent the degree of mildew infestation at the four different stages of winter wheat growth. 
mikro_1, mikro_2, mikro_3: These variables represent the microclimate conditions during three different periods of winter wheat growth.
middel_1, middel_2, middel_3: These variables represent the average amount of fungicide applied during the three different periods of winter wheat growth. 
nedboer_1, nedboer_2, nedboer_3: These variables represent the amount of precipitation during the three different periods of winter wheat growth. 
udbytte: This variable represents the yield of the winter wheat crop.

Analyze the causality between each pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. 
Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.
```

```
Based on the provided variables, I will analyze the causality between each pair of variables. Note that the analysis is based on the assumptions provided and does not take into account any other potential factors that may influence the variables.
1. <edge>dm_1->foto_1</edge>`  
Edge: `dm_1`->`foto_1`  
Reason: As the dry mass (`dm_1`) of the winter wheat increases at the beginning of growth, the photosynthetic rate (`foto_1`) will likely increase as the plant has more resources available for photosynthesis.  
2. <edge>dm_2->foto_2</edge>
Edge: `dm_2`->`foto_2</edge> 
Reason: Similar to the first edge, as the dry mass (`dm_2`) of the winter wheat increases at a later stage of growth, the photosynthetic rate (`foto_2`) will likely increase due to the availability of more resources.  
3. <edge>dm_3->straaling_3</edge>
Edge: `dm_3`->`straaling_3`  
Reason: As the dry mass (`dm_3`) of the winter wheat increases, the plant will likely have a greater capacity to absorb solar radiation (`straaling_3`) for photosynthesis.  
4. <edge>dm_4->straaling_4</edge>
Edge: `dm_4`->`straaling_4`  
Reason: Similarly, as the dry mass (`dm_4`) of the winter wheat increases at the final stage of growth, the plant will be able to absorb more solar radiation (`straaling_4`) for photosynthesis.  
5. <edge>temp_1->foto_1</edge>
Edge: `temp_1`->`foto_1`  
Reason: Higher temperature (`temp_1`) at the beginning of winter wheat growth can lead to an increase in the photosynthetic rate (`foto_1`) as it enhances photosynthetic processes.  
6. <edge>temp_2->foto_2</edge>
Edge: `temp_2`->`foto_2`  
Reason: As the temperature (`temp_2`) increases at a later stage of growth, it can lead to an increase in the photosynthetic rate (`foto_2`) due to the favorable conditions for photosynthesis.  
7. <edge>temp_3->foto_3</edge>
Edge: `temp_3`->`foto_3`  
Reason: A similar relationship exists between temperature (`temp_3`) and photosynthetic rate (`foto_3`) at the third stage of growth.  
8. <edge>temp_4->foto_4</edge>
Edge: `temp_4`->`foto_4`  
Reason: The relationship between temperature (`temp_4`) and photosynthetic rate (`foto_4`) at the final stage of growth is similar to the previous edges.  
9. <edge>lai_1->meldug_1</edge>
Edge: `lai_1`->`meldug_1`  
Reason: As the Leaf Area Index (`lai_1`) increases at the beginning of winter wheat growth, there is more surface area for mildew to infest, potentially leading to a higher degree of mildew infestation (`meldug_1`).  
10. <edge>lai_2->meldug_2</edge>
Edge: `lai_2`->`meldug_2`  
Reason: A similar relationship exists between the Leaf Area Index (`lai_2`) and the degree of mildew infestation (`meldug_2`) at the second stage of growth.  
11. <edge>lai_3->meldug_3</edge>
Edge: `lai_3`->`meldug_3`  
Reason: The relationship between the Leaf Area Index (`lai_3`) and the degree of mildew infestation (`meldug_3`) at the third stage of growth is similar to the previous edges.  
12. <edge>mikro_1->meldug_1</edge>
Edge: `mikro_1`->`meldug_1`  
Reason: Microclimate conditions during the first period of winter wheat growth (e.g., humidity, temperature) can influence the degree of mildew infestation (`meldug_1`).  
13. <edge>mikro_2->meldug_2</edge>
Edge: `mikro_2`->`meldug_2`  
Reason: Similar to the previous edge, microclimate conditions
