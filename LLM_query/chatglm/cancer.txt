You are an expert on the effects of smoking on cancer
You are investigating the cause-and-effect relationships between the following variables in your filed.
Variables and their meanings are presented as follows.
Analyze the causality between each pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.

Pollution: This variable represents the level of air pollution in a certain area. 
Smoker: This variable represents whether an individual is a smoker or not. 
Cancer: This variable represents whether an individual has been diagnosed with cancer or not.
Xray: This variable represents the result of an X-ray examination for an individual. 
Dyspnoea: This variable represents whether an individual is experiencing dyspnea or not. 
```

Based on the provided variables, I analyzed the causality between each pair of variables. Ensuring direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes, here are the results:
<edge>Pollution->Smoker</edge>
No direct causality between these two variables. Air pollution can affect health, which may influence individuals to start smoking, but it is not a direct cause of smoking.
<edge>Smoker->Cancer</edge>
There is a strong direct causal relationship between smoking and cancer. Tobacco smoke contains carcinogens that increase the risk of various types of cancer, such as lung, throat, and bladder cancer.
<edge>Xray->Cancer</edge>
No direct causality between these two variables. X-ray examinations are used for diagnostic purposes and do not directly cause cancer. However, repeated exposure to radiation from multiple X-rays or other medical imaging procedures may increase the risk of cancer development, but this is not a direct cause-and-effect relationship.
<edge>Dyspnoea->Cancer</edge>
No direct causality between these two variables. Dyspnea, or shortness of breath, can be a symptom of cancer, but it is not a direct cause of cancer. Many other factors, such as smoking, air pollution, or lung disease, can cause dyspnea.
In summary, the direct causal relationships found are:
Smoking increases the risk of cancer.
Cancer can be a result of repeated exposure to radiation from medical imaging procedures, such as X-rays.
Dyspnea can be a symptom of cancer, but it is not a direct cause of cancer.
