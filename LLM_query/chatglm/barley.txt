You are an expert in designing decision support systems for growing malt without the use of pesticides.
Variables and their meanings are presented as follows.
please remember these variables and their meanings. the next question will use them 
```

```
jordtype: Soil type. This variable represents the different soil types
komm: Community or municipality.
nedbarea: Precipitation area.
nmin: Mineral nitrogen content in the soil 
aar_mod: Year modifier. 
forfrugt: Preceding crop. 
potnmin: Potential mineral nitrogen content in the soil.
pesticid: Pesticide usage. 
exptgens: Experimental yield loss percentage.
mod_nmin: Modified mineral nitrogen content in the soil.
ngodnt: Nitrogen content in the grain at optimal nitrogen treatment .
nopt: Optimal nitrogen content .
ngodnn: Nitrogen content in the grain at non-optimal nitrogen treatment .
ngodn: Nitrogen content in the grain.
nprot: Nitrogen content in the protein.
saatid: Sowing date.
rokap: Rooting capacity.
dgv1059: Grain yield at 10.5% moisture content.
```

```
Analyze the causality between each pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.
```

```
Based on the variables provided, I have identified direct causal relationships between some of the variables. Please note that for some variables, there might not be a direct causal relationship, and their correlation might be due to common causes or indirect effects.
Here are the direct causal relationships:
<edge>jordtype->komm</edge>: Soil type can affect the community or municipality in which the malt is grown, as different soil types can support different crops and agricultural practices, which may be specific to certain communities.
<edge>komm->nedbarea</edge>: Community or municipality can affect the precipitation area, as localized climate patterns and weather systems can vary from one community to another, impacting the amount of rainfall received.
<edge>nedbarea->nmin</edge>: Precipitation area can affect the mineral nitrogen content in the soil, as more rainfall can lead to higher soil moisture levels and increased nitrogen availability.
<edge>nmin->aar_mod</edge>: Mineral nitrogen content in the soil can affect the year modifier, as different nitrogen levels might impact the growth and development of the malt crop across different years.
<edge>forfrugt->potnmin</edge>: Preceding crop can affect the potential mineral nitrogen content in the soil, as the residues from previous crops can contribute to the overall nitrogen availability in the soil.
<edge>potnmin->mod_nmin</edge>: Potential mineral nitrogen content in the soil can affect the modified mineral nitrogen content in the soil, as any adjustments made to the soil's nitrogen content, such as adding fertilizers or cover crops, can change the available nitrogen for the malt crop.
<edge>mod_nmin->ngodnt</edge>: Modified mineral nitrogen content in the soil can affect the nitrogen content in the grain at optimal nitrogen treatment, as the available nitrogen in the soil can influence the plant's ability to absorb and utilize nitrogen, ultimately affecting the grain quality.
<edge>ngodnt->nopt</edge>: Nitrogen content in the grain at optimal nitrogen treatment can affect the optimal nitrogen content, as the grain quality achieved under optimal nitrogen conditions can be used as a benchmark for determining the optimal nitrogen level required for the crop.
<edge>ngodnn->ngodn</edge>: Nitrogen content in the grain at non-optimal nitrogen treatment can affect the nitrogen content in the grain, as the difference in grain quality between optimal and suboptimal nitrogen treatments can provide insights into the impact of nitrogen levels on grain quality.
<edge>nprot->ngodn</edge>: Nitrogen content in the protein can affect the nitrogen content in the grain, as the protein content of the grain is influenced by the overall nitrogen availability and utilization in the plant.
<edge>saatid->dgv1059</edge>: Sowing date can affect the grain yield at 10.5% moisture content, as the timing of sowing can influence the growth and development of the malt crop, ultimately impacting its yield.
<edge>rokap->dgv1059</edge>: Rooting capacity can affect the grain yield at 10.5% moisture content, as the ability of the plant to establish a strong root system can affect its overall growth and yield.
These direct causal relationships help to identify the key factors influencing the growth and development of malt without the use of pesticides.
