You are an expert in wastewater treatment control systems.
Variables and their meanings are presented as follows.
please remember these variables and their meanings. the next question will use them 
```

```
C_NI_12_00, C_NI_12_15, C_NI_12_30, C_NI_12_45: These variables seem to represent the number of nitrogen inorganic ions for different time periods (00, 15, 30, and 45 minutes).
CKNI_12_00, CKNI_12_15, CKNI_12_30, CKNI_12_45: These variables represent the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen inorganic (CKNI) ions at the same time periods as above.
CBODD_12_00, CBODD_12_15, CBODD_12_30, CBODD_12_45: These variables represent the carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD) for degradable organic matter at the specified time periods.
CKND_12_00, CKND_12_15, CKND_12_30, CKND_12_45: These variables represent the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen degradable (CKND) ions at the specified time periods.
CNOD_12_00, CNOD_12_15, CNOD_12_30, CNOD_12_45: These variables represent the concentration of nitrogenous oxygen demand (CNOD) at the specified time periods.
CBODN_12_00, CBODN_12_15, CBODN_12_30, CBODN_12_45: These variables represent the carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand for nitrogenous (CBODN) matter at the specified time periods. 
CKNN_12_00, CKNN_12_15, CKNN_12_30, CKNN_12_45: These variables represent the concentration of Kjeldahl nitrogen non-degradable (CKNN) ions at the specified time periods. 
CNON_12_00, CNON_12_15, CNON_12_30, CNON_12_45: These variables represent the concentration of nitrogenous non-degradable organic nitrogen (CNON) at the specified time periods.

Analyze the causality between each pair of variables in the form of <edge>variable1->variable2</edge>, and give the reason. 
Ensure direct causality of outputs, not indirect causality due to common causes.
```

```
Based on the variables provided, here are the direct causal relationships between each pair of variables:
<edge>CBODN_12_00->CBODD_12_00</edge>
<edge>CBODN_12_15->CBODD_12_15</edge>
<edge>CBODN_12_30->CBODD_12_30</edge>
<edge>CBODN_12_45->CBODD_12_45</edge>
<edge>CKNI_12_00->CNOD_12_00</edge>
<edge>CKNI_12_15->CNOD_12_15</edge>
<edge>CKNI_12_30->CNOD_12_30</edge>
<edge>CKNI_12_45->CNOD_12_45</edge>
<edge>CKND_12_00->CNOD_12_00</edge>
<edge>CKND_12_15->CNOD_12_15</edge>
<edge>CKND_12_30->CNOD_12_30</edge>
<edge>CKND_12_45->CNOD_12_45</edge>
<edge>CKNN_12_00->CNOD_12_00</edge>
<edge>CKNN_12_15->CNOD_12_15</edge>
<edge>CKNN_12_30->CNOD_12_30</edge>
<edge>CKNN_12_45->CNOD_12_45</edge>
